    <baseDescription>When [PAWN_nameDef] was just a mere hatchling, [PAWN_possessive] colony was raided by an opposing pack. Luckily, they never found little [PAWN_nameDef], who was hid away before the attack. Only a few days later, [PAWN_pronoun] was found by explorers, who luckily decided to take [PAWN_nameDef] back home with them. [PAWN_nameDef] lived a relatively normal life afterwards, not even made aware of [PAWN_possessive] past until adulthood.</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had a rough early adulthood. They were framed for a murder in [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon, despite [PAWN_possessive] having no connection. The colony's leaders stated otherwise. [PAWN_nameDef] was banished from the pack, left alone to the worst parts of the Avalon tundra. Of course, the issue wasn't so much surviving, but the crippling loneliness, and the lack of food. Mirraciously, [PAWN_nameDef] found another pack after years of being alone, and slowly accustomed back to normal life. Being in complete isolation for years made it extremely hard to return to socializing, plus [PAWN_pronoun] didn't learn much technology-wise in the Avalon tundra.

	After a few years, [PAWN_nameDef] was caught, and placed into an Avali prisoner program. [PAWN_nameDef] is now being sent to a foreign planet for some kind of expedition, but [PAWN_pronoun] was too busy pickpocketing the instructor to really be listening.

Nonetheless, [PAWN_nameDef] continued to hone their trade, developing many odd trinkets, even if [PAWN_nameDef] couldn't do [PAWN_possessive] dream designs such as "A giant robotic centipede with machine guns attached to it" or "A portable device that can generate tornadoes on command".

    <baseDescription>On Avalon, mining is a crucial part of the economy, many basic Avali resources are based on precious rocks and metals found deep in caves or mountains. It also so happens that mining is an extremely dangerous job, and some people let the glowy rocks down below get to their heads; and that is not just a metaphor.
	
	[PAWN_nameDef]'s job entails digging into collapsed mining areas, and rescuing whoever is still alive. Sadly, it seems giant boulders usually beat Avali, but [PAWN_nameDef] has seen and dealt with quite a few different emergency situations, and is always ready for the next idiot who doesn't understand basic gravity.

Soon, [PAWN_nameDef] heard of a new oppurtunity to get off of Avalon with a small group, and quickly enlisted. They want to be the authority to a pack they truly respect.</baseDescription>

They dedicated their entire life to picking up all the skills neccesary to survive, wanting to be the best possible choice. Sadly, [PAWN_pronoun] was called out to duty years before [PAWN_pronoun] anticipated, having been able to only pick up bare minimums. I guess there is no better way to learn then doing it yourself, for real, right?</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] is part of an extremely strange cult that believes that all plants are the work of some ancient evil, and they all must be destroyed or they will corrupt the world. Somehow, [PAWN_pronoun] snuck [PAWN_objective]selves onto the colony program. They probably aren't fit for this new environment, but there is no going back now. [PAWN_nameDef] will not fight fires, believing that fires are the cleansing graces of their deity.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was just born absolutely stunning, and everyone agrees. [PAWN_nameDef] spent most of their life as an Avali model, taking constant photoshoots, featuring in movies, varying in... theme. However, this life grew boring to [PAWN_objective]. Being so high up in the Avali society, [PAWN_pronoun] heard about the colony program before anyone else. However, the colony program wouldn't allow many high-class Avali such as [PAWN_objective]self.
	
	So, [PAWN_nameDef] tired of [PAWN_possessive] life as a celebrity, allowed [PAWN_objective]self into the program by sneaking onto a ship as it was leaving. Will they be able to live without the same glamour?

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] made a living running [PAWN_possessive] own food cart, simply grilling hamburgers and selling them to passerby in city squares. However, Avali cities just don't have the population/economy to make this a liveable practice, and [PAWN_nameDef] turned to other options out of desperation for money. Now they are a colonist ready to land on a largely unknown, extremely dangerous, extremely vital planet. [PAWN_nameDef] wonders if they should have stuck with the "AvaliBurger" cart.

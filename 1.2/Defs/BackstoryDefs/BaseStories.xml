    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] had a rough early adulthood. They were framed for a murder in [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon, despite [PAWN_possessive] having no connection. The colony's leaders stated otherwise. [PAWN_nameDef] was banished from the pack, left alone to the worst parts of the Avalon tundra. Of course, the issue wasn't so much surviving, but the crippling loneliness, and the lack of food. Mirraciously, [PAWN_nameDef] found another pack after years of being alone, and slowly accustomed back to normal life. Being in complete isolation for years made it extremely hard to return to socializing, plus [PAWN_pronoun] didn't learn much technology-wise in the Avalon tundra.
	
	[PAWN_nameDef] swears to find the true murderer one day.</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] made [PAWN_possessive] living back on Avalon by petty thievery, shoplifting, and running black market goods. However, even those endeavours started to prove ineffective in fufilling [PAWN_nameDef]'s crave for possessions, so they then stepped up to muggings, kidnappings, ransom, robberies, and many more goodies.
	
	After a few years, [PAWN_nameDef] was caught, and placed into an Avali prisoner program. [PAWN_nameDef] is now being sent to a foreign planet for some kind of expedition, but [PAWN_pronoun] was too busy pickpocketing the instructor to really be listening.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] never really worked for anyone in particular, finding [PAWN_possessive] lifestyle in making, restoring, improving, changing, destroying, and designing countless odd machines. At home, [PAWN_pronoun] was disregarded for the bizarre creations [PAWN_pronoun] made, dismissed as being "absolutely impractical" and "having less worth then a wet dishrag." Nonetheless, [PAWN_nameDef] continued to hone their trade, developing many odd trinkets, even if [PAWN_nameDef] couldn't do [PAWN_possessive] dream designs such as "A giant robotic centipede with machine guns attached to it" or "A portable device that can generate tornadoes on command".

	But, this isn't Avalon anymore. Maybe [PAWN_nameDef]'s creations will finally be recognized for what they are worth on this new world?

    <baseDescription>On Avalon, mining is a crucial part of the economy, many basic Avali resources are based on precious rocks and metals found deep in caves or mountains. It also so happens that mining is an extremely dangerous job, and some people let the glowy rocks down below get to their heads; and that is not just a metaphor.
	
	[PAWN_nameDef]'s job entails digging into collapsed mining areas, and rescuing whoever is still alive. Sadly, it seems giant boulders usually beat Avali, but [PAWN_nameDef] has seen and dealt with quite a few different emergency situations, and is always ready for the next idiot who doesn't understand basic gravity.

[PAWN_nameDef] has since then avoided actually installing the parts; they just wanna make them.

[PAWN_pronoun] could never seem to get a break. One day, after another "lost my PDA in the snow" report, [PAWN_nameDef] snapped, leaving the town and taking all [PAWN_possessive] gear with [PAWN_objective]. Soon, [PAWN_nameDef] heard of a new oppurtunity to get off of Avalon with a small group, and quickly enlisted. They want to be the authority to a pack they truly respect.</baseDescription>

    <title>Avali Model</title>
    <titleShort>Model</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was just born absolutely stunning, and everyone agrees. [PAWN_nameDef] spent most of their life as an Avali model, taking constant photoshoots, featuring in movies, varying in... theme. However, this life grew boring to [PAWN_objective]. Being so high up in the Avali society, [PAWN_pronoun] heard about the colony program before anyone else. However, the colony program wouldn't allow many high-class Avali such as [PAWN_objective]self.
	
	So, [PAWN_nameDef] tired of [PAWN_possessive] life as a celebrity, allowed [PAWN_objective]self into the program by sneaking onto a ship as it was leaving. Will they be able to live without the same glamour?

    <titleShort>Foodcart Owner</titleShort>
    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] made a living running [PAWN_possessive] own food cart, simply grilling hamburgers and selling them to passerby in city squares. However, Avali cities just don't have the population/economy to make this a liveable practice, and [PAWN_nameDef] turned to other options out of desperation for money. Now they are a colonist ready to land on a largely unknown, extremely dangerous, extremely vital planet. [PAWN_nameDef] wonders if they should have stuck with the "AvaliBurger" cart.

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] always had a fascination with animals, and was always curious as to what was possible with them. [PAWN_nameDef] nearly had developed a module that would allow Avali to speak with animals using common brain signals, however, all of [PAWN_nameDef]'s work was destroyed in a freak accident in [PAWN_possessive] lab, and [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to relocate [PAWN_possessive] studies elsewhere.

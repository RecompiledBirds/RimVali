    <storyDesc>When [PAWN_nameDef] was just a mere hatchling, [PAWN_possessive] colony was raided by an opposing pack. Luckily, they never found little [PAWN_nameDef], who was hid away before the attack. Only a few days later, [PAWN_pronoun] was found by explorers, who luckily decided to take [PAWN_nameDef] back home with them. [PAWN_nameDef] lived a relatively normal life afterwards, not even made aware of [PAWN_possessive] past until adulthood.</storyDesc>

    <storyDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] had a rough early adulthood. They were framed for a murder in [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon, despite [PAWN_possessive] having no connection. The colony's leaders stated otherwise. [PAWN_nameDef] was banished from the pack, left alone to the worst parts of the Avalon tundra. Of course, the issue wasn't so much surviving, but the crippling loneliness, and the lack of food. Mirraciously, [PAWN_nameDef] found another pack after years of being alone, and slowly accustomed back to normal life. Being in complete isolation for years made it extremely hard to return to socializing, plus [PAWN_pronoun] didn't learn much technology-wise in the Avalon tundra.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] swears to find the true murderer one day.</storyDesc>

[PAWN_nameDef] is now being sent to a foreign planet for some kind of expedition, but [PAWN_pronoun] was too busy pickpocketing the instructor to really be listening.

    <storyDesc>On Avalon, mining is a crucial part of the economy, many basic Avali resources are based on precious rocks and metals found deep in caves or mountains. It also so happens that mining is an extremely dangerous job, and some people let the glowy rocks down below get to their heads; and that is not just a metaphor.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef]'s job entails digging into collapsed mining areas, and rescuing whoever is still alive. Sadly, it seems giant boulders usually beat Avali, but [PAWN_nameDef] has seen and dealt with quite a few different emergency situations, and is always ready for the next idiot who doesn't understand basic gravity.

[PAWN_nameDef] was often completely swamped with tasks, because even though the pack was fairly small (to Avali standards, anyway), [PAWN_nameDef] still had many tasks to do. [PAWN_pronoun] could never seem to get a break. One day, after another "lost my PDA in the snow" report, [PAWN_nameDef] snapped, leaving the town and taking all [PAWN_possessive] gear with [PAWN_objective]. Soon, [PAWN_nameDef] heard of a new oppurtunity to get off of Avalon with a small group, and quickly enlisted. They want to be the authority to a pack they truly respect.</storyDesc>

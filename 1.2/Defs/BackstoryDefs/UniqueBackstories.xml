    <baseDescription>Danny spent most of his life as a dreamer, out of place for being born into such a small pack. Once he was of age, he declared himself leader of his pack, which they gladly followed. He than began a campaign that lasted months, attempting to unify the avali local to him under a singular state. Tragedy struck, when during a battle, a stray bullet hit him right in the head. However... He survived. Danny woke up, dazed in an empty field, unsure of what was going on. He was found there by a neutral pack, who didn't seem to understand what he was saying. He still searches for his lost pack. Also, he may have a slight case of severe brain damage.</baseDescription>

    <storyDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] had always felt as if not all rules applied to them. Most of [PAWN_possessive] free time was spent along a thin line between legal and illegal be it through grifting valuable assets from notable personalities or having a small edge ahead of everyone else at the gambling table. It didn't take long for their acquired skills to evolve into a lifestyle and that lifestyle into a very real issue with the law. Eventually, [PAWN_pronoun] was forced to flee from their past actions and has found themselves on this planet. Their wild personality makes it very difficult for them to focus on a project for an extended period of time however.</storyDesc>

    <storyDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] had a rough early adulthood. They were framed for a murder in [PAWN_possessive] pack back on Avalon, despite [PAWN_possessive] having no connection. The colony's leaders stated otherwise. [PAWN_nameDef] was banished from the pack, left alone to the worst parts of the Avalon tundra. Of course, the issue wasn't so much surviving, but the crippling loneliness, and the lack of food. Mirraciously, [PAWN_nameDef] found another pack after years of being alone, and slowly accustomed back to normal life. Being in complete isolation for years made it extremely hard to return to socializing, plus [PAWN_pronoun] didn't learn much technology-wise in the Avalon tundra.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] swears to find the true murderer one day.</storyDesc>

    <storyDesc>On Avalon, mining is a crucial part of the economy, many basic Avali resources are based on precious rocks and metals found deep in caves or mountains. It also so happens that mining is an extremely dangerous job, and some people let the glowy rocks down below get to their heads; and that is not just a metaphor.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef]'s job entails digging into collapsed mining areas, and rescuing whoever is still alive. Sadly, it seems giant boulders usually beat Avali, but [PAWN_nameDef] has seen and dealt with quite a few different emergency situations, and is always ready for the next idiot who doesn't understand basic gravity.

[PAWN_nameDef] was often completely swamped with tasks, because even though the pack was fairly small (to Avali standards, anyway), [PAWN_nameDef] still had many tasks to do. [PAWN_pronoun] could never seem to get a break. One day, after another "lost my PDA in the snow" report, [PAWN_nameDef] snapped, leaving the town and taking all [PAWN_possessive] gear with [PAWN_objective]. Soon, [PAWN_nameDef] heard of a new oppurtunity to get off of Avalon with a small group, and quickly enlisted. They want to be the authority to a pack they truly respect.</storyDesc>

    <shortTitle>Foodcart Owner</shortTitle>
    <storyDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] made a living running [PAWN_possessive] own food cart, simply grilling hamburgers and selling them to passerby in city squares. However, Avali cities just don't have the population/economy to make this a liveable practice, and [PAWN_nameDef] turned to other options out of desperation for money. Now they are a colonist ready to land on a largely unknown, extremely dangerous, extremely vital planet. [PAWN_nameDef] wonders if they should have stuck with the "AvaliBurger" cart.
